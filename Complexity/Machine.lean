/-!
A concrete deterministic one-tape Turing machine. Each `run` step executes one
finite-control instruction. The tape is infinite in both directions, with an
implicit blank beyond each stored list. The output convention is the consecutive
bits beginning at the final head position, ending at the first non-bit symbol.
